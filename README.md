# Merge Sort Implementation

This repository contains the implementation of the **Merge Sort** algorithm, a divide-and-conquer sorting technique known for its stability and efficiency.

## Overview
Merge Sort is an efficient sorting algorithm with the following key characteristics:

- **Time Complexity:**
  - Best Case: O(n log n)
  - Average Case: O(n log n)
  - Worst Case: O(n log n)
- **Space Complexity:** O(n) (additional space for merging)
- **Algorithm Type:** Comparison-based, stable

## Features
- Implemented in **C++**.
- Supports sorting arrays/lists of integers, floats, or other comparable data types.
- Includes recursive and iterative variants for flexibility.

## File Structure
- `MergeSort.cpp`: Contains the implementation of Merge Sort.
- `README.md`: Documentation for the repository.

## How to Use
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/merge-sort.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the repository folder:
   ```bash
   cd merge-sort
   ```
3. Compile the code:
   ```bash
   g++ -o merge_sort MergeSort.cpp
   ```
4. Run the executable:
   ```bash
   ./merge_sort
   ```

## Algorithm Steps
1. Divide the input array into two halves.
2. Recursively sort each half.
3. Merge the sorted halves into a single sorted array.

## Example Input and Output
### Input
```plaintext
Array: [4, 10, 3, 5, 1]
```
### Output
```plaintext
Sorted Array: [1, 3, 4, 5, 10]
```
